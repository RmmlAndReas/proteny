proteny
=======

A tool to analyze synteny at the protein level.
We develop an algorithm to detect statistically significant clusters of exons between two proteomes.
The tool provides algorithms to quickly detect and visualize results in order to support conclusions from genomic data.

The method discovers clusters of hits from a bi-directional BLASTp of translated exon sequences in two organisms.
A dendrogram for hits is built based on genomic distances between hits, and cut based on significance of a cluster score based on a permutation test at each node in the tree.
The result is a set of large clusters describing high exonic conservation.

Algorithm
=========

We use BLASTp to produce a set of hits, which are used to build

a dendrogram which is traversed to find

significant clusters

Which are then visualized in a useful way

Dependencies
=============
 * CIRCOS: http://circos.ca/
 * IBIDAS: https://github.com/mhulsman/ibidas
 * BLAST+: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/

Usage
=========

Make sure that each dependency (and their dependencies) is installed.
modify the "$CIRCOS" variable in "run" to reflect the location of your circos installation.

"example.py" contains an example which details the way the tool can be used.
"run" is a script which actually runs circos finding each configuration file.

'''shell
$> ipython
In [1]: execfile("example.py");
'''
